"""Module for working with plane waves and plane wave models.

The plane wave is defined as $e^{-ik(r-r_c)^T d}$ where r is the position, d is the direction of the plane wave.
and r_c is the expansion center (the point around which the directions are calculated). 

Using the time-harmonic convention of $exp(-iwt)$, the plane wave is defined as $exp(ikr^T d)$ where d is the plane 
wave propagation direction [martinMultiple2006]. Therefore the direction provided is the direction from which the plane wave is incoming.

    Parameters
    ----------
    plane_wave_data : ndarray of shape (num_mic, 1)
        data from a plane wave or plane-wave like sound field that should be matched by the analytic plane wave
    freq : float
        frequency of the plane wave

        Direction from which the plane wave is incoming. Must be a unit vector
    pos_mic : ndarray of shape (num_mic, 3)
        positions of the microphones (the points where the plane wave and the plane_wave_data are measured)
    c : float
        speed of sound

    Returns
    -------
    p_mic_analytic : ndarray of shape (num_mic, 1)
        the sound pressure at pos_mic of the analytic plane wave that matches the plane_wave_data. 
        If plane_wave_data is a plane wave or very close, then p_mic_analytic should be 
        essentially identical to plane_wave_data
    exp_center : ndarray of shape (1, 3)

    gain_adjustment : float
        A gain adjustment that should be applied to the analytic plane wave to match the plane_wave_data
    
        
    Notes
    -----
    The gain adjustment is found as the mean amplitude of the plane_wave_data. 

    The phase adjustment is found as the solution to $\lVert e^{i \gamma} \bm{p} - \bm{s} \rVert_2^2$, where $\bm{p}$ is 
    the vector of analytic pressure values and $\bm{s}$ is the vector of plane_wave_data. The solution is found analytically
    by taking the derivative and setting to zero. 

    The expansion center is defined by $exp(-ik(r-r_c)^T d) = exp(-i gamma) exp(ikr^T d)$, where r_c is the unknown expansion center
    and the phase adjustment gamma is found by the algorithm. Since that relationship is not necessarily unique, the 
    expansion center is found as min \lVert r_c \rVert_2^2 subject to r_c^T d = gamma / wave_num, which is a 
    least squares problem with linear constrained, solved analytically using the Lagrange multiplier method.
